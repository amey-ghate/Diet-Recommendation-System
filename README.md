### Motivation
People from all around the world are getting more concerned in their health and way of life in today's modern environment. However, avoiding junk food and exercising alone are insufficient; we also need to eat a balanced diet. We can live a healthy life with a balanced diet based on our height, weight, and age. Your diet can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight, lower your chance of developing chronic diseases (including cancer and heart disease), and improve your general health when combined with physical activity. Nevertheless, there is a little SOTA project on food/diet recommendation system. Therefore I got the idea to build a content-based recommendation system for this purpose using machine learning. 
### What is a food recommendation engine?
A food recommendation engine using a content-based approach is an important tool for promoting healthy eating habits. This type of engine uses information about the nutritional content and ingredients of foods to make personalized recommendations to users. One of the key advantages of a content-based approach is that it takes into account an individual's dietary restrictions and preferences, such as allergies or food preferences. By providing users with tailored recommendations, a content-based food recommendation engine can help them make better choices about what to eat and improve their overall health. Additionally, by recommending a variety of healthy foods, it can also help users to discover new and nutritious options, expand their dietary horizons and overcome food boredom. All these can lead to a better and well-rounded diet, which can have a positive impact on long-term health outcomes.

### What is a content-based recommendation engine?
A content-based recommendation engine is a type of recommendation system that uses the characteristics or content of an item to recommend similar items to users. It works by analyzing the content of items, such as text, images, or audio, and identifying patterns or features that are associated with certain items. These patterns or features are then used to compare items and recommend similar ones to users.

### Why content-based approach?

* No data from other users is required to start making recommendations.
* Recommendations are highly relevant to the user.
* Recommendations are transparent to the user.
* You avoid the “cold start” problem. 
* Content-based filtering systems are generally easier to create.

### Challenges of content-based approach
* There’s a lack of novelty and diversity.
* Scalability is a challenge.
* Attributes may be incorrect or inconsistent. 

### This Diet Recommendation System is using Streamlit and FastAPI in order to develop an interactive website for the users.
